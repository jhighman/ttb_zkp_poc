# Trua ZKP Demo: Investor Overview

## Executive Summary

This demonstration showcases Trua's zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) technology in action, specifically for job eligibility verification. The demo illustrates how applicants can prove they meet employment requirements without revealing sensitive personal data like actual TruaScores or background details.

## Business Context

### The Problem
In today's digital landscape, trust verification typically requires exposing sensitive personal information:
- Social Security numbers
- Full background check reports
- Detailed financial histories
- Complete employment records

This creates privacy risks, compliance challenges, and data security vulnerabilities for both individuals and organizations.

### Trua's Solution
Zero-knowledge proofs enable verification without revelation:
- **Prove eligibility** without showing actual scores
- **Verify credentials** without exposing personal identifiers
- **Establish trust** while maintaining privacy
- **Ensure compliance** without data overexposure

## Technical Innovation

### Zero-Knowledge Proof Implementation
Our demo uses cutting-edge cryptographic techniques:

- **Circom Circuit Language**: Defines the mathematical constraints for eligibility verification
- **Groth16 Proving System**: Generates succinct, fast-to-verify proofs
- **SnarkJS Library**: Enables browser-based proof generation and verification
- **Trusted Setup**: Cryptographic ceremony ensuring proof system security

### Key Components

#### 1. TruaScore Verification
- **Range**: 0-360 (realistic risk assessment scale)
- **Thresholds**: 
  - 270+ = Acceptable
  - 240-270 = Borderline
  - <240 = Poor
- **Privacy**: Actual score never revealed, only eligibility status

#### 2. Disqualifier Logic
- **Triplet Model**: Relevancy × Recency × Type
- **Boolean Logic**: Any true disqualifier fails eligibility
- **Privacy**: Specific disqualifiers remain hidden

#### 3. Cryptographic Proof
- **Input**: Private applicant data (score, disqualifiers)
- **Output**: Public proof of eligibility (true/false)
- **Verification**: Mathematically guaranteed without data exposure

## Market Opportunity
