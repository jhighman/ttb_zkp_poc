# ZKP Job Eligibility Demo

A comprehensive demonstration of zero-knowledge proof technology for privacy-preserving job eligibility verification, inspired by Trua's trust platform.

## üéØ Overview

This demo showcases how Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) can revolutionize the hiring process by allowing applicants to prove they meet job requirements without revealing sensitive personal information. Employers receive definitive yes/no answers about eligibility while applicant privacy is completely preserved.

## üîê Key Benefits

### For Applicants
- **Complete Privacy**: Actual scores and background details remain hidden
- **Selective Disclosure**: Only eligibility status is revealed
- **Data Control**: Applicants maintain control over their sensitive information
- **Reduced Bias**: Employers can't make decisions based on irrelevant details

### For Employers
- **Verified Compliance**: Cryptographic proof of requirement satisfaction
- **Efficient Screening**: Quick yes/no answers without manual review
- **Legal Protection**: Reduced exposure to discriminatory hiring practices
- **Trust Without Exposure**: Verification without data liability

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Components

1. **Circom Circuit** (`circuits/eligibility.circom`)
   - Defines the zero-knowledge proof logic
   - Checks TruaScore thresholds and disqualifier constraints
   - Ensures privacy preservation through cryptographic constraints

2. **Web Interface** (`src/`)
   - Modern, responsive HTML/CSS/JavaScript application
   - Educational tooltips explaining ZKP concepts
   - Interactive employer and applicant interfaces

3. **Proof System**
   - SnarkJS for browser-based proof generation
   - Groth16 proving system for efficiency
   - Client-side verification for immediate results

## üìä Demo Scenarios

### Applicant Profiles

| Profile | TruaScore | Disqualifiers | Expected Result |
|---------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Applicant A** | 320 | None | ‚úÖ Eligible |
| **Applicant B** | 250 | DUI | ‚ùå Score borderline + DUI |
| **Applicant C** | 290 | Felony | ‚ùå Disqualified by felony |
| **Applicant D** | 340 | Old misdemeanor | ‚úÖ Eligible (if not relevant) |
| **Applicant E** | 180 | Multiple issues | ‚ùå Poor score + multiple issues |

### Job Requirements

Employers can configure:
- **Minimum TruaScore**: 0-360 threshold
- **Relevant Disqualifiers**: 
  - Felony convictions (last 5 years)
  - DUI convictions (last 3 years)
  - License suspensions
  - Misdemeanor convictions (last 3 years)
  - Outstanding warrants

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Python 3.7+ (for local server)
- Modern web browser with JavaScript enabled

### Installation

1. **Clone and Setup**
   ```bash
   cd zkp-job-demo
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the Demo Server**
   ```bash
   python3 server.py
   ```

3. **Open in Browser**
   Navigate to: `http://localhost:8000/index.html`

### Usage

1. **Set Job Requirements** (Employer)
   - Adjust minimum TruaScore using the slider
   - Select relevant disqualifiers for the position

2. **Select Applicant Profile**
   - Choose from predefined test profiles
   - Review profile details (normally hidden from employer)

3. **Generate Proof**
   - Click "Generate ZK Proof & Check Eligibility"
   - Watch the proof generation process
   - View results with privacy explanation

## üî¨ Technical Details

### ZKP Circuit Logic

The Circom circuit implements two main constraints:

1. **Score Verification**
   ```circom
   component scoreCheck = GreaterEqThan(10);
   scoreCheck.in[0] <== applicant_score;
   scoreCheck.in[1] <== required_score;
   scoreCheck.out === 1;
   ```

2. **Disqualifier Checks**
   ```circom
   for (var i = 0; i < n; i++) {
       component check = IsZero();
       check.in <== relevant[i] * disqualifier[i];
       check.out === 1;
   }
   ```

### Privacy Guarantees

- **Zero-Knowledge**: Proof reveals nothing beyond eligibility
- **Soundness**: Invalid proofs cannot be generated
- **Completeness**: Valid eligibility always produces valid proofs

### Performance Metrics

- **Proof Generation**: ~2-3 seconds (simulated)
- **Verification**: <100ms
- **Proof Size**: ~200 bytes
- **Circuit Constraints**: 30 total (21 non-linear, 9 linear)

## üéì Educational Features

### Interactive Tooltips

The demo includes comprehensive tooltips explaining:
- Zero-knowledge proof concepts
- TruaScore methodology

### Workflow Visualization

Step-by-step demonstration of:
1. Employer requirement setting
2. Applicant proof generation
3. Cryptographic verification
4. Result interpretation
